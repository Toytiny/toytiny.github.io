<h2>about me</h2>
I am a final-year PhD student from the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh, sponsored by the <a href="https://www.edinburgh-robotics.org/" target="_blank">EPSRC CDT in Robotics and Autonomous Systems</a>, supervised by <a href="https://christopherlu.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Chris Xiaoxuan Lu</a> and <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/bwebb/" target="_blank">Prof. Barbara Webb</a>. 

üôè I will graduate in **Summer 2025** and am actively seeking a postdoctoral or industrial position, starting from my graduation.

My research focuses on advancing the robustness, efficiency, and privacy-awarness of perception systems for **embodied AI**. These efforts support applications in mobile robots, autonomous vehicles, AIoT and xR-integrated systems, aiming to facilitate their **widespread, long-horizon and non-intrusive** deployment in the wild. Currently, my works primarily involve the imaging modalities that operate beyond visible spectrum, e.g., mmWave radar and thermal, leveraging their unique sensing resilience to cope with **adverse weather, variable illumination and occlusion** challenges in real world.

<!-- I am also keen to incorporate full-spectral multi-modal fusion into my research field. -->

Before coming to Edinburgh, I received my B.Eng degree with the highest honour - <a href="https://news.tongji.edu.cn/info/1003/76035.htm?ivk_sa=1023197a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Academic Star</a> and was awarded double National Scholarships from <a href="https://en.tongji.edu.cn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tongji University</a> (2017-2021).

<!-- where I worked in the <a href="https://vision4robotics.github.io/" target="_blank">V4R lab</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Changhong-Fu" target="_blank">Dr. Changhong Fu</a>. In August 2020, I visited Tsinghua University and conducted on-site research under the supervison of <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38237039900" target="_blank">Dr. Geng Lu</a>.  -->
üëâ I am looking for self-motivated UG/Ms students to work with me and my collaborators at UoE/UCL/ETH/MIT/Oxford/Cambridge/NTU on **cutting-edge** research projects.

<!-- , including but not limited to: 
-  **Mapping**: All-day scene completion with thermal imaging for mobile autonomy  
-  **Scene Understanding**: Robust and low-cost perception enabled by surrounding 4D radars
-  **Human Motion**: Human motion reconstruction from mmWave raw data via Diffusion
-  **Representation Learning**: Pre-trained transformer for heterogeneous radar sensors -->

Support in the form of **sufficient** computational and sensory tools, robot platform, alongside **practical** supervision and direction, is available. Please contact directly via email if you are interested.

üëâ I am actively looking for a research intern position this year. Shoot me an email if you think I am a good fit!
